/**
 * Thematiq Migrate Stored Class Names Repair Step
 *
 * Repair step that rewrites this app's own fully-qualified class names where
 * Nextcloud has STORED them, across the `OCA\NLDesign\` -> `OCA\Thematiq\`
 * namespace rename that accompanied the `nldesign` -> `thematiq` app-id rename.
 *
 * A stored class name is a different problem from a stored setting. The other
 * two rename steps ({@see MigrateAppConfigKeys}, {@see MigrateUserPreferences})
 * move rows between two app-id namespaces and never look at the VALUES. This
 * step is the opposite: one fixed slot, whose value is a class name that no
 * longer resolves.
 *
 * WHAT IS ACTUALLY STORED. Exactly one thing, and this was established by
 * inventory rather than assumed — every other candidate was checked and ruled
 * out (see "WHY ONLY ONE" below). Nextcloud's `mail_template_class` SYSTEM
 * config entry, in `config.php`, names the class the server instantiates for
 * every outbound email. When an admin enables email theming,
 * {@see \OCA\Thematiq\Service\EmailThemingService::enable()} writes this app's
 * template class into it. On an instance themed before 2026-08-22 that value
 * still reads `OCA\NLDesign\Mail\NLDesignEMailTemplate`, and that class does not
 * exist any more.
 *
 * THE TWO FAILURES THIS REPAIRS, BOTH SILENT.
 *
 *   1. EVERY BRANDED EMAIL SILENTLY REVERTS TO STOCK. Nextcloud's
 *      `OC\Mail\Mailer::createEMailTemplate()` guards the stored value with
 *      `class_exists($class) && is_a($class, EMailTemplate::class, true)` and
 *      falls back to the plain `EMailTemplate` when it fails. So the stale
 *      value does not raise — the government branding, logo and statutory
 *      footer just stop appearing on password resets, share notifications and
 *      every other mail, with nothing in any log.
 *
 *   2. THE ADMIN IS LOCKED OUT OF FIXING IT, AND MISINFORMED ABOUT WHY.
 *      `EmailThemingService::getState()` classifies the stored value as
 *      `enabled` when it equals the CURRENT template class, `disabled` when it
 *      is empty, and `foreign` otherwise. The app's own pre-rename value is
 *      neither of the first two, so it is reported as `foreign` — and
 *      `enable()` refuses a foreign class with `ForeignMailTemplateClassException`
 *      (HTTP 409). The admin panel therefore shows email theming as OFF,
 *      refuses to switch it back on, and blames a third-party template that
 *      does not exist. This step is the only thing that clears that state
 *      short of hand-editing config.php.
 *
 * WHY ONLY ONE. The other places a class name could be persisted were checked
 * and each is either self-healing or not this app's to touch:
 *   - `oc_jobs` stores the background job FQCN, and the pre-rename row does say
 *     `OCA\NLDesign\BackgroundJob\UpstreamFreshnessJob`. It needs no migration:
 *     `OC\BackgroundJob\JobList::getNext()` removes a row whose class no longer
 *     exists ("Remove job from disabled app or old version of an app") and
 *     installing `thematiq` re-registers the job from `<background-jobs>`.
 *     Writing a step for it would add a race against the server's own cleanup
 *     for no gain.
 *   - This app has no `lib/Settings/*register*.json`, no `register.d/`, and no
 *     seeded OpenRegister object descriptors — so there are no stored schema or
 *     object FQCNs.
 *   - No `IAppConfig` or `IConfig` value in this app holds a class name;
 *     `setSystemValue()` is called in exactly one place, the one above.
 *   - `lib/Controller/HealthController.php` holds two FQCN string constants,
 *     but they name OPENREGISTER classes
 *     (`OCA\OpenRegister\AppHost\Observability\*`). Those are cross-app runtime
 *     lookups: they may only move when OpenRegister's own classes move, and
 *     rewriting them here would silently no-op the integration.
 *
 * NOT A COPY BUT A REWRITE, AND WHY THAT IS STILL SAFE. The other two steps
 * copy and leave the source intact so a rollback finds its data. There is no
 * equivalent here: `mail_template_class` is a single slot, and leaving the
 * stale value in place IS the defect. A rollback to the old app id would find
 * the new class name and fall back to the stock template — the same degraded
 * behaviour it has today, not a worse one, and it never loses data because the
 * previous value is written to the log and to the repair output before it is
 * replaced.
 *
 * SAFETY. Idempotent, conservative, and non-throwing:
 *   - it rewrites ONLY the exact old FQCN. An empty value, the already-migrated
 *     value, and a genuinely foreign third-party template are all left exactly
 *     as they are — this step never enables email theming on an instance that
 *     had not enabled it, and never clobbers another vendor's template;
 *   - a second run finds the new value and is a no-op;
 *   - `config.php` can be read-only (`config_is_read_only`, or a filesystem
 *     chmod that only surfaces as a throw from the write itself). Both are
 *     caught and reported with the exact `occ` command to run by hand, because
 *     an admin who cannot be told this has no way to discover it;
 *   - it NEVER throws. Registered under `<install>` — the only hook that fires
 *     on the fresh install a rename actually performs — an escaping exception
 *     aborts the install and the app never enables at all. A stale mail
 *     template is not worth the whole app.
