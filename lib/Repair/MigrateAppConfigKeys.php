/**
 * Thematiq Migrate App Config Keys Repair Step
 *
 * Repair step that carries this app's stored `IAppConfig` values across the
 * `nldesign` -> `thematiq` APP-ID rename.
 *
 * THE APP ID MOVED; THE DESIGN SYSTEM DID NOT. `nldesign` here means the old
 * Nextcloud app id and nothing else. The NL Design System's own names — the
 * `nldesign` CSS custom properties, class prefixes, the `nldesign` design-system
 * id in design-systems.json — did not change and are not touched by this step.
 *
 * Nextcloud namespaces `IAppConfig` by app id at the storage layer
 * (`oc_appconfig.appid`), so renaming `<id>` does not rename the rows — it makes
 * every previously stored value unreachable, because the app now asks for them
 * under a different app id. There is no in-place app-id upgrade in Nextcloud:
 * the new id is simply a different app. This step therefore copies each value
 * from the old namespace to the new one.
 *
 * WHAT IS ACTUALLY AT STAKE. Every reader here supplies a default, so a lost
 * value does not error — it reverts, silently, with no log line to notice. For
 * a THEMING app that means the instance visibly changes appearance and nothing
 * anywhere says why:
 *   - `token_set` is the active token set id — the Rijkshuisstijl, Utrecht,
 *     Amsterdam, Den Haag or Rotterdam brand the instance is themed with. Its
 *     readers default to `'nextcloud'` ({@see ComplianceReportService},
 *     {@see EmailThemingService}), so losing it silently reverts a themed
 *     government instance to stock Nextcloud blue.
 *   - `custom_token_sets` holds admin-authored brands that exist nowhere else;
 *     `custom_fonts` / `custom_fonts_rev` the uploaded font manifest;
 *     `primary_color` / `background_color` the manual overrides.
 *   - `disabled_apps` ({@see AppThemingService}) and `group_token_sets` /
 *     `group_token_sets_generation` ({@see GroupThemingService}) are the
 *     per-app and per-group exclusions. Lose them and theming silently starts
 *     applying to apps and groups an admin deliberately excluded — a change in
 *     behaviour, not just in configuration.
 *   - `email_footer_org_name`, `email_footer_accessibility_url` and
 *     `email_footer_privacy_url` are the statutory footer fields; the
 *     accessibility-statement URL is a legal obligation for Dutch public bodies.
 *   - `custom_css_enabled`, `hide_slogan`, `show_menu_labels`, `icon_pack`,
 *     `marianne_enabled` and `dark_variants` are the remaining admin toggles.
 *
 * WHY EVERY KEY RATHER THAN A FIXED LIST. The admin settings are not the whole
 * stored set — {@see ThemingAuditService} keeps the `audit_entries_total`
 * counter, the theming sync keeps `theming_syncs_total`, and past releases have
 * written keys this app no longer reads. Enumerating `IAppConfig::getKeys()` is
 * exhaustive by construction and cannot drift out of date the way a hardcoded
 * list does.
 *
 * THE KEY NAMES ARE COPIED VERBATIM. No app config key in this app embeds the
 * app id — they are all bare names like `token_set`, `icon_pack`,
 * `custom_fonts` — so there is no key-name prefix to rewrite. (Had there been
 * one, rewriting the NAME as well as moving the row would be mandatory: a value
 * copied under a name nothing reads is the same silent loss this step exists to
 * prevent.)
 *
 * ORDERING. Registered FIRST in both blocks of `appinfo/info.xml`, ahead of
 * `GenerateDarkVariantsRepairStep`, and that order is load-bearing as a
 * standing invariant: any step that writes configuration under the new app id
 * before this one runs would leave those keys already present under `thematiq`,
 * and this step would skip them as "already present", stranding the old values
 * under `nldesign` where nothing reads them.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE TOUCHES `mail_template_class`. That value is a Nextcloud SYSTEM
 * config entry in `config.php`, not an app-config row, and it holds a class name
 * rather than a setting — {@see MigrateStoredClassNames} owns it. This step
 * moves the app's own configuration namespace only.
 *
 * SAFETY. Idempotent and non-destructive:
 *   - a key is copied only when the old value is non-empty AND the new
 *     namespace does not already hold a value, so an admin edit made after the
 *     rename is never clobbered and a second run is a no-op;
 *   - the old `nldesign` rows are never deleted, so a rollback to the previous
 *     app id still finds its configuration intact;
 *   - values round-trip as raw strings. `IAppConfig` stores every value as a
 *     string and the typed accessors only coerce on read, so a string
 *     round-trip cannot lose or corrupt a value written by a typed setter;
 *   - BOTH the reads and the write sit inside the try, not just the write. A
 *     throwing read would otherwise escape `run()`, and because this step is
 *     registered under `<install>` — the only hook that fires on the fresh
 *     install the rename actually performs — an escaping throw aborts the
 *     install and the app never enables at all. Every route in the app dies
 *     with it. One unreadable config value is not worth that.
