## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change fix-readiness-claims. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Manifest Licence Matches the Bundled Licence
`appinfo/info.xml` `<licence>` MUST declare the same licence family as the root `LICENSE` file and the SPDX headers of the PHP sources. The bundled `LICENSE` is the European Union Public Licence v1.2 and every `lib/**/*.php` file carries `SPDX-License-Identifier: EUPL-1.2`, so `<licence>` MUST be `eupl` and MUST NOT be `agpl`. The `<description>` MUST also state the EUPL-1.2 licence in prose, consistent with the rest of the Conduction fleet.

#### Scenario: Declared licence equals the bundled licence
@e2e exclude static metadata invariant — PHPUnit/grep asserts info.xml and LICENSE agree, not a UI flow
- GIVEN the shipped app package
- WHEN `appinfo/info.xml` `<licence>` is read
- THEN it MUST equal `eupl`
- AND the first line of `LICENSE` MUST contain "EUROPEAN UNION PUBLIC LICENCE"
- AND `<description>` MUST mention the EUPL-1.2 licence

#### Scenario: SPDX headers agree with the manifest
@e2e exclude static source invariant — PHPUnit scans lib/ headers
- GIVEN every PHP file under `lib/`
- WHEN its `SPDX-License-Identifier` tag is read
- THEN it MUST be `EUPL-1.2`
- AND no `lib/` PHP file MUST declare AGPL

### Requirement: Government Checklist States the Real Licence and Host
`docs/GOVERNMENT-FEATURES.md` — used by procuring organizations as a Programma van Eisen checklist — MUST state the real licence (EUPL-1.2) and the canonical source host (`codeberg.org/Conduction/nldesign`). It MUST NOT state AGPL, and open-source / source-access rows MUST NOT reference GitHub as the canonical repository.

#### Scenario: Checklist licence and host are correct
@e2e exclude documentation invariant — checked against the shipped doc, not a UI flow
- GIVEN `docs/GOVERNMENT-FEATURES.md`
- WHEN the "Licentie" line and the open-source technical row are read
- THEN the licence MUST read EUPL-1.2 (never AGPL)
- AND the source-access reference MUST point at the Codeberg repository (never GitHub)

### Requirement: Font Delivery Documented as Bundled and Self-Hosted
Nextcloud enforces a strict Content-Security-Policy and government instances are frequently air-gapped, so the app MUST bundle Fira Sans as self-hosted `.woff2/.woff` files under `css/fonts/` and load them from `css/fonts.css` with app-relative `url()` only. Documentation MUST describe this delivery and MUST NOT instruct or claim that fonts load from an external CDN when the code contains no external font URL.

#### Scenario: Stylesheet uses only bundled fonts
@e2e exclude static asset invariant — PHPUnit inspects css/fonts.css and css/fonts/
- GIVEN `css/fonts.css`
- WHEN its `url()` references are inspected
- THEN none MUST use an `http://` or `https://` scheme
- AND every referenced `css/fonts/*.woff2` file MUST exist on disk

#### Scenario: Documentation matches the bundled delivery
@e2e exclude documentation invariant — checked against README/compliance docs
- GIVEN the font sections of `README.md` and `docs/reference/compliance.md`
- WHEN they describe how the font is delivered
- THEN they MUST describe self-hosted, app-bundled woff2 delivery
- AND they MUST NOT claim CDN/jsdelivr loading, nor that the font files are "not loaded"

### Requirement: Token-Set Count Claims Match the Inventory
Every human-readable statement of how many token sets ship — `appinfo/info.xml` `<description>`, `README.md`, `project.md`, and the documentation — MUST agree with the number of entries in `token-sets.json` (equivalently, the `css/tokens/*.css` inventory). A statement enumerating a subset MUST either enumerate accurately or state the true total.

#### Scenario: README count equals the inventory
@e2e exclude static inventory invariant — PHPUnit compares README count to token-sets.json length
- GIVEN the token-set count stated in `README.md`
- WHEN compared with the length of `token-sets.json`
- THEN the two MUST be equal
- AND `project.md` MUST NOT state a different total

### Requirement: Token Audit Scope Stated Honestly
`docs/reference/token-audit.md` MUST state which token sets have actually been reviewed and MUST NOT assert a blanket production verdict ("100/100", "APPROVED FOR PRODUCTION", "all token sets reviewed") that covers sets which were never audited. Sets that are community-derived and not individually reviewed MUST be labelled as unaudited.

#### Scenario: Audit doc scopes its verdict to reviewed sets
@e2e exclude documentation invariant — checked against the shipped doc
- GIVEN `docs/reference/token-audit.md`
- WHEN the audited scope is read
- THEN it MUST name the manually-reviewed sets (currently the original five)
- AND it MUST mark the remaining shipped sets as not individually audited
- AND no "APPROVED FOR PRODUCTION" verdict MUST be stated as covering the unaudited sets

### Requirement: Marianne Licensing Is Stated Honestly

Every human-readable statement about Marianne MUST describe its real, legally-restricted situation and MUST NOT overclaim or underclaim.
Marianne is a legally restricted French-State asset now bundled behind a gate, so `README.md`,
the relevant `docs/` page (font delivery / compliance), and any in-product notice
MUST state that Marianne is bundled self-hosted under the Etalab Open Licence
2.0 (from `@gouvfr/dsfr`), that it is the official typeface of the French State reserved for
French State administrations, that it is **off by default** and activated only when an admin
acknowledges the organisation is a French State agency, and that Inter is used otherwise. The
documentation MUST NOT claim Marianne is an unconditionally free/open font, and MUST NOT (as the
pre-change text did) assert that "no Marianne file exists anywhere in the app" now that the
gated files ship. Statements about font delivery MUST remain consistent with the
`### Requirement: Font Delivery Documented as Bundled and Self-Hosted` requirement — self-hosted,
app-relative, no CDN.

#### Scenario: Docs describe the gated, restricted Marianne accurately
@e2e exclude documentation invariant — checked against the shipped README/docs, not a UI flow

- GIVEN the Marianne sections of `README.md` and the font-delivery `docs/` page
- WHEN they describe Marianne
- THEN they MUST state it is bundled self-hosted under Etalab Open Licence 2.0, restricted to
  French State agencies, and off by default until an admin acknowledges eligibility
- AND they MUST NOT describe Marianne as an unconditionally free/open font
- AND they MUST NOT claim that no Marianne file ships in the app

#### Scenario: No claim that Marianne loads from an external host
@e2e exclude static asset invariant — PHPUnit inspects the Marianne stylesheet and docs

- GIVEN `css/systems/lasuite/marianne.css` and the documentation describing its delivery
- WHEN the `url()` references and the doc prose are read
- THEN none MUST use an `http://` or `https://` scheme
- AND the documentation MUST NOT claim CDN loading nor that Marianne is fetched from an external
  server

### Requirement: Declared Nextcloud Range Matches What CI Actually Tests

The `<nextcloud min-version>` declared in `appinfo/info.xml` is a promise the Nextcloud app store
passes on to administrators: it decides which servers are offered this app. That promise MUST be
backed by an exercised configuration. The declared floor MUST equal the LOWEST Nextcloud ref in
`nextcloud-test-refs` in `.github/workflows/code-quality.yml`, and `max-version` MUST be at least
the highest such ref.

Both directions are defects, and this repository has shipped each of them:

- **Floor above the matrix.** `min-version` is enforced at install time, so a floor higher than a
  tested ref makes `occ app:enable` refuse on that leg, and the failure surfaces as an unrelated
  "app is not installed or enabled" error much later in the run.
- **Floor below the matrix.** A floor lower than every tested ref advertises versions no leg has
  ever exercised. Nothing reports it, because a version that is never tested cannot go red.

#### Scenario: Declared floor equals the lowest tested Nextcloud ref
@e2e exclude manifest/CI invariant — PHPUnit reads `appinfo/info.xml` and the workflow, not a UI flow

- GIVEN `appinfo/info.xml` declares `<nextcloud min-version="X" max-version="Y"/>`
- AND `.github/workflows/code-quality.yml` pins `nextcloud-test-refs` to a JSON list of `stableNN`
  refs
- WHEN the declared range is compared with that list
- THEN no tested ref MUST be below `X`
- AND the lowest tested ref MUST equal `X`
- AND `Y` MUST be greater than or equal to the highest tested ref

#### Scenario: Declared PHP floor is satisfiable on the declared Nextcloud floor
@e2e exclude manifest invariant — PHPUnit reads `appinfo/info.xml`

- GIVEN `appinfo/info.xml` declares `<php min-version="8.3"/>`
- WHEN the declared Nextcloud floor is read
- THEN it MUST be at least 32, the first Nextcloud release whose own PHP floor is 8.3
- AND a lower Nextcloud floor MUST be treated as a contradiction between the two declarations,
  not as a wider support range
