/**
 * GRADIENT HANDLING - DOCUMENTED LIMITATION
 * 
 * Nextcloud core uses inline CSS gradients (background-image: linear-gradient())
 * combined with -webkit-mask-image for most navigation icons.
 * 
 * These inline styles have the highest CSS specificity and cannot be overridden
 * with external stylesheets. This is a Nextcloud core limitation.
 * 
 * DECISION: Accept gradient icons as-is to maintain stability and functionality.
 * 
 * Note: SVG-based icons (like some app icons) can have gradients removed,
 * but this affects a minority of icons and isn't worth the trade-offs.
 */

/* This file intentionally left minimal to document the limitation. */
/* No aggressive overrides that break layout or functionality. */
